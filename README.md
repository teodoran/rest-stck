REST-STCK
=========

STCK as a Service (SaaS/ACaaS) Much REST! Such HATEOAS!

What is this?
-------------

Imagine a wonderful world where turing-complete computation could be preformed through elegant REST APIs.
No longer just a fantasie, REST-STCK introduces REST-based computing to the masses.

Based on the award-winning, enterprise-grade programming language [STCK](https://github.com/teodoran/stck), frontend developers can now leverage the power of arbitrary computation as a service (ACaaS).
